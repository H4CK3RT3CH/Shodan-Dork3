How to search on the shodan.io website

## Basics ##
The Shodan website uses the ** filtername:value ** structure for searches, where the filter is the type of thing you are searching for and the value is the specific example:

* hostname:example.com

## Who ##
A good starting point is the organisation you are seeking to find assets for.

** Organisation **
* org:example.com








## Learning By Doing ##
When viewing an individual result, click ** View Raw Data ** to explore other filters you can use from results.
